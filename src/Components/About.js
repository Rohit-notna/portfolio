I've learned and mastered key technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Tailwind, and Material UI. During the course, I successfully created a website that works well on different devices and is hosted on Google. I used React.js and Tailwind for this project.In the real estate project, I incorporated advanced features, implementing JWT for secure authentication and hashed passwords to safeguard user data. The responsive UI design, powered by React, Bootstrap, and Tailwind CSS, facilitated an improved user experience. Employing Redux for efficient state management and MongoDB for data storage, I introduced user management functionalities, enabling account updates, deletions, and secure sign-out.

The platform also supports property listing operations, allowing users to effortlessly upload details, pictures, and edit or delete listings. A robust search functionality was implemented, enabling users to find properties based on diverse criteria. Stringent data security measures were applied to protect user and property information, leveraging technologies such as Firebase and Git.I stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in web development, and my hands-on experience makes me a valuable asset in this field. I pay close attention to detail, love creating solutions that users will find helpful, and have a proven track record of delivering top-notch, responsive websites.</p>
